This document outlines conventions to be used for Docker and Kubernetes within Atlas projects. Naming conventions, path conventions, and so on are covered here.

# Docker 

## Organization in Harbor

When arranging your images within Harbor (or any similar container registry that uses a Project and Repository-based structure), follow these conventions. For more basic registries (e.g. Azure Container Registry) that only support Repositories, see the [below section](#organization-in-other-container-registries).

### Projects

Project names should be `kebab-case`; in other words, all lowercase with hyphen-separated words.

For images which can be cleanly attributed to a single effort, product, or system, a Harbor project should be created representing that system. For example, if you're working on Alerting Studio, images that are a part of it should live within the `alerting-studio` project.

When the image is a **base image**, to be consumed by many other (uncategorized or ungroupable) images, use the existing `base-images` project. Base images used only by a single system or product should fall under that system's project.

If the image is a **generic tool** or utility to be used for, as an example, performing manual admin tasks in a customized environment (e.g. a preconfigured image for utilizing Crunchydata's PGO client), it should use the existing `tools` project.

Images **replicated** directly from another registry (like Docker Hub) go into the `library` project.

Images pushed **temporarily** to test something out can go into the `temp` projectâ€”they will be deleted after a week by a project-wide tag retention policy. (Obviously this is specific to our Harbor instance and probably doesn't exist in other registries.)

### Repositories/Image Names

Quick conventions:

* Image names should be `kebab-case`.
* Despite them being organized under projects, try to name images uniquely. 
    - In scenarios where the image name is the same beneath multiple projects, several assumptions may be made (correct or incorrect) about how they relate.
* The name should be descriptive of the application(s) being run within the container.
    - If the image is intended as a layer/base image, it should describe what the image adds to the stack.
* It is valid to use slashes within image names to create pseudo-subcategories where doing so helps organize the images into logical units.
    - For example: `base-images/dotnet/sdk`, where `base-images` is the project name and `dotnet/sdk` is the image name.
    - Try to avoid using more than one of these extra subcategories.

## Organization in other Container Registries

The major difference between Harbor and more basic registries is that Harbor has a lot of additional functionality around managing repositories and tags. None of this additional functionality is available in something like Azure Container Registry (at least, not the Basic SKU), and as a result these registries will follow similar but slightly altered conventions.

Starting with the same conventions as Harbor, the following differences apply:

* As there is no concept of a Project, you should instead use additional pseudo-subcategories within your repository/image names. An example comparison:
    - Harbor: Project `alerting-studio`, repository named `front-end/alerting-app`
    - Basic registry: Repository named `alerting-studio/front-end/alerting-app`
* Try to avoid using more than 2 categories (3 total identifiers) in a basic registry.
    - Example of what **not** to do:
        + `base-images/microsoft/mcr/dotnet/sdk`
    - Counter-example of how it should be done:
        + `base-images/dotnet/sdk`
* There is no `temp` project. You should not push temporary images to the registry.
* The `tools`, `library`, and `base-images` projects also do not exist, but repository names can continue to follow those conventions in their naming scheme.
* Replication functionality is often not available, so replications from other registries will need to be done through other means.

## Tags

Repositories containing application code (e.g. modules of a system that are deployable and runnable) should always have at least 3 tags:

* `latest`
* A version number equivalent to the version number of the module/component within, following the guidelines expressed in the [Product Lifecycle Requirements](../Projects/product-lifecycle-requirements.md) doc. The `v` prefix is not needed; for example, the `v` in `v1.3` is unnecessaryâ€”just `1.3` will suffice for the tag.
* A build number that corresponds directly to the CI/CD pipeline build number that caused the image to be pushed.
    - If the version number of the module _is_ the build number, then one tag satisfies both requirements.

Obviously, as more builds are produced and more versions released, there will be many tags for different versions and builds. `latest` will always represent the most recently pushed version.

Repositories containing images used for layering or as base images exclusively should always be very specific with their tags. They _cannot_ have a `latest` tag. Especially if the image takes dependencies on third-party modules or images, the tag must contain the dependency versions. Example:

* `tools/python-poetry:3.7-slim-1.0.5` indicates that the `tools/python-poetry` image with tag `3.7-slim-1.0.5` takes dependencies on:
    - `python:3.7-slim`
    - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) version 1.0.5

Replications from another registry **must also replicate specific tags**. They cannot replicate `latest`.

## Dockerfile Location

As a default, the Dockerfile for a repo should live at its root. This is because, for most projects, in order for the Dockerfile to have access to all of the files necessary to build the image, it needs to be at the rootâ€”Docker does not allow files to be referenced which live above the Dockerfile in the folder hierarchy.

However, in the following situations, the Dockerfile can be moved elsewhere:

* If only part of the repo is actually touched by the Dockerfile, it can live within the highest relevant folder.
    - In larger repos with multiple deployments, this is often necessary (although having large repos with multiple deployments is discouraged).
    - Here's a trivial example:

# Kubernetes

## Naming and Path Conventions

File names and object names should be `kebab-case`.

When organizing manifests, it's better to split each object into its own YAML file. Name it after the object type. If you have more than one manifest of the same type, prefix it with the name of the object or its purpose (e.g. `postgres-data-pvc.yaml`). Any [short name/abbreviation supported by `kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#resource-types) is allowed.

As for path conventions within your source directory, it's a good idea to put deployment scripts and resources in their own directory. Especially if you're using Kustomize with one or more overlays, you'll need to keep things organized and away from your actual source code. Here's an example (from this very doc site, abridged):


wzxhzdk:1


The manifests live in a `kubernetes` folder beneath `deploy` as a best practice. In case the application needs to deploy to other environments, the pathing required by `kustomization` files isn't broken when things get rearranged.

A few applications were developed before these conventions were finalized. These are just conventions, but it is strongly recommended that we keep consistency between projects. So, if your repo doesn't follow these guidelines, you should restructure it to do so unless it absolutely doesn't make sense for your project.

## Labels

Labels are a very important piece of identifying metadata in a Kubernetes manifest. They may just be key-value pairs, but among other uses, they're the most common way to associate objects together (such as pieces of a named deployment). These associations are used for more than just notation; they're often used to connect pieces together.

### Labels and Services

The most often applied use case for labels is to tie pods together such that they can be referenced by a service. A service can represent a number of related (or potentially unrelated) pods, and those pods are usually selected using labels. Here's an example deployment and service:


wzxhzdk:2



wzxhzdk:3


You'll notice the use of `app: test-nginx` in several places. This key-value pair denotes that the labeled resources (including pods spun up by the deployment) are part of the `test-nginx` application. The `nginx-svc` service then uses that label as a selector to define which pods should be represented by the service.

### Labels and Filtering

Labels do still serve as important metadata, despite their functional nature. This metadata can make management and maintenance of a Kubernetes cluster easier. For example, label selectors can be used not only in specifications, but also in API queries. As a result, if you have other metadata that can help describe or organize the resource, add it. See [this page from the Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#list-and-watch-filtering) for more info.

Just be careful that you don't cross concerns with other resources in unintended ways, and know that while labels themselves can be changed after deployment, **label selectors are immutable**. For example, the `matchLabels` selector often used in `Deployment` resources to tell the deployment which pods it should own is immutable, and Kubernetes will enforce that the deployment's selector matches the pod template's labels.

### Label Conventions

Now armed with an understanding of labels, here are the conventions around the minimum way they should be used in our environment. Kubernetes' official docs has [a set of recommended labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/) but they're fairly verbose, so these are the ones we'll use. 

Be careful to standardize around these labels as much as realistically possible. They often only provide value when many deployments utilize them in the same wayâ€”if one deployment uses `environment: dev` and the other `environment: development`, they can't be grouped together.

_(Note that `kustomize` provides a way to apply common labels to an entire deployment.)_

**Strongly Recommended Labels:**

* `app`, the name of the application (in kebab-case). 
    - App labels should be authoritative even if multiple instances exist. For example, if two different systems have deployed nginx, both should have the `app: nginx` label. Selectors will use additional labels to refine which instance is intended, if not both.
* `environment`, one of `dev`, `preprod`, `production`, or similar.
* `part-of`, the name of the system or higher-level app this one is part of. 
    - Examples: `retool`, `reporting-studio`, `etl-framework`, `etl-dashboard`
* `component`, referring to which component of the app's architecture this app fulfills.
    - Examples: `database`, `webserver`, `api`, `cache`, `queue`, `worker`

**Optional Labels:**

* An additional descriptor complimenting `component` which further differentiates the component from others like it, using the value of the `component` as the key.
    - Examples of differentiation:
    - `database: postgres` vs `database: mysql`
    - `webserver: nginx` vs `webserver: httpd`
    - `queue: rabbitmq` vs `queue: kafka`
    - It may seem like there's some redundancy with the `app` label here, but `app` can often be the name of the application _built on top of_ one of these core platforms.
        + For example, `app: atlas-postgres-retool` describes a customized Postgres deployment for Retool. A label of `database: postgres` allows your pods to be grouped together with other Postgres pods, no matter how they're deployed. This could be used in monitoring, for example.
* `tier`, a label describing the architectural tier that the component in question fulfills. 
    - Example `tier: frontend` on a webserver hosting a site.
    - Usually, you'll only see two tiers: `frontend` and `backend`. This label is used as a sanity check to make sure resources go to the proper places for some apps which are customer facing (e.g. DMZ cluster), and to apply network policies or monitor network traffic in different ways.
* `instance`, providing a unique instance name to further differentiate your `app`'s name from others, when other labels aren't used/can't be used to do so.
    - For example, if your application employs multiple `redis` instances for different purposes, an `instance` label could help you differentiate them instead of using different `app` labels for each.
    - `instance: redis-file-cache` and `instance: redis-query-cache`
* `version`, the version of the application deployed. This is at the bottom of the list because:
    - Label selectors are immutable once the resources are created, but often you will want to upgrade versions in place - which means you cannot use `version` in selectors without taking a dependency on destroying and recreating the resources every time you want to upgrade.
    - The version can probably be inferred by the image tag, assuming the images you rely on use well-tagged images (they should) and your pod specs refer to specific tags (they also should).
    - Still, this can be useful for complex applications where you may be relying on various interdependent components at different versions, but together they represent the whole application's version.

**Full Example:**

Here's the tags that might be used for each component in an example system running the <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">Example Atlas Service Product</span><sup>â„¢</sup>.

| Unit | `app` | `environment` | `part-of` | `component` | Addl. Descriptor | `tier` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Server hosting the web app** | `nginx-with-proxy` | `production` | `example-service-product` | `webserver` | `webserver: nginx` | `frontend` |
| **API the web app calls** | `example-service-api` | `production` | `example-service-product` | `api` | `api: aspnetcore-kestrel` | `frontend` |
| **Cache used by the API** | `redis` | `production` | `example-service-product` | `cache` | `cache: redis` | `backend` |
| **Database** | `atlas-postgres` | `production` | `example-service-product` | `database` | `database: postgres`| `backend` |

## Annotations

The primary difference between labels and annotations in Kubernetes is the intention of each. Since labels can be queried/filtered/selected by the core system, they are intended to be used for _identifying_ data. Annotations are not to be used for identifiers, as they cannot be used in selectors and are not designed for efficient querying. As such, they can be used for arbitrary metadata wherever it makes sense.

Quick conventions:

* When a deployment is issued, the `change-cause` annotation should be updated to reflect it. It should include the source of the change. 
    - For example, this docsite annotates the deployment with this command after the rollout using an Azure DevOps task:
        - `kubectl annotate deployment/eng-docsite kubernetes.io/change-cause="Azure DevOps - $(Release.DefinitionName) - $(Release.ReleaseWebURL)"`
* Where possible, resources should be annotated with a build ID from the CI/CD system as a `build` annotation.
* Resources deployed through a pipeline should carry an artifact of their release as a `release` annotation.
    - One such case is when resources are deployed through Azure DevOps. Resources deployed through a pipeline should be annotated with the release ID and/or the release name. E.g. `release: "Release-47"` (see [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=batch#default-variables---release) for Azure DevOps release variables).
